* Licenses

Restlet is an Open Source project that is distributed under several licenses at the same time.
Users can choose one of the following open source licenses:

- LGPL license 3.0 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)
- LGPL license 2.1 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.php)
- CDDL license 1.0 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php)
- EPL license 1.0 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php)

In addition, we want to expressly mention that Noelios Technologies, the only copyright holder
of the whole source code, has no intention to release future versions of the Restlet open source
project under more restrictive licences (such as GPL). If we change the license again in the
future, it could only be for a less restrictive license (such as Apache Software License).
Otherwise, LGPL, CDDL and EPL licensing will always be available.

The CDDL license is based on the Mozilla Public License used for the Firefox browser. It is a
flexible license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) encouraging contributions back to
the project. It is used by Sun Microsystems to distribute its OpenSolaris or GlassFish projects.
If you have questions about this license, you can refer to their CDDL FAQ.

The EPL license was defined by the Eclipse foundation and has properties similar to the LPGL and
CDDL licenses. If you have questions about this license, you can refer to their EPL FAQ.

Licenses for special usages, like embedding in proprietary products without the constraint of
giving access to the Restlet source code found in the Open Source licenses, or commercial usage
of the Restlet trademark can also be discussed with Noelios Technologies.
